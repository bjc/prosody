TRUNK
=====

## New

### Administration

- Add 'watch log' command to follow live debug logs at runtime (even if disabled)
- mod_announce: Add shell commands to send messages to all users, online users, or limited by roles

### Networking

- Honour 'weight' parameter during SRV record selection
- Support for RFC 8305 "Happy Eyeballs" to improve IPv4/IPv6 connectivity
- Support for TCP Fast Open in server_epoll (pending LuaSocket support)
- Support for deferred accept in server_epoll (pending LuaSocket support)

### MUC

- Component admins are no longer room owners by default. This can be reverted
  to the old behaviour with `component_admins_as_room_owners = true`, but this
  has known incompatibilities with some clients. Instead, use the shell or
  ad-hoc commands to gain ownership of rooms when necessary.
- Permissions updates:
  - Room creation restricted to local users (of the parent host) by default
    - restrict_room_creation = true restricts to admins, false disables all restrictions
  - Persistent rooms can only be created by local users (parent host) by default
    - muc_room_allow_persistent = false restricts to admins
  - Public rooms can only be created by local users (parent host) by default
    - muc_room_allow_public = false restricts to admins
- Commands to show occupants and affiliations in the Shell
- Save 'reason' text supplied with affiliation change

### Security and authentication

- Advertise supported SASL Channel-Binding types (XEP-0440)
- Implement RFC 9266 'tls-exporter' channel binding with TLS 1.3
- Implement 'tls-server-end-point' channel binding
- New role and permissions framework and API
- Ability to disable and enable user accounts
- Full DANE support for s2s
- A "grace period" is now supported for deletion requests via in-band registration

### Storage

- New 'keyval+' combined keyval/map store type
- Performance improvements in internal archive stores
- Ability to use SQLite3 storage using LuaSQLite3 instead of LuaDBI

### Module API

- Config interface API can require that string values be picked from a provided set
- Acceptable interval can be specified for number options
- Method for parsing time periods / intervals from config
- Method for retrieving integer settings from config
- It is now easy for modules to expose a Prosody shell command, by adding a shell-command item
- Modules can now implement a module.ready method which will be called after server initialization

### Configuration

- The configuration file now supports referring and appending to options previously set
- Direct usage of the Lua API in the config file is deprecated, but can now be accessed via Lua.* instead
- Convenience functions for reading values from files, with variant meant for credentials or secrets

## Changes

- Support sub-second precision timestamps
- mod_blocklist: New option 'migrate_legacy_blocking' to disable migration from mod_privacy
- Moved all modules into the Lua namespace `prosody.`
- Forwarded header from RFC 7239 supported, disabled by default
- mod_http_file_share now uses roles framework, affecting access from e.g. components
- Intervals of mod_cron managed periodic jobs made configurable
- When mod_smacks is enabled, s2s connections not responding to ack requests are closed.
- Arguments to `prosodyctl shell` that start with ':' are now turned into method calls
- Support for Type=notify and notify-reload systemd service type added
- Support for the roster *group* access_model in mod_pep
- Support for systemd socket activation in server_epoll
- mod_invites_adhoc gained a command for creating password resets
