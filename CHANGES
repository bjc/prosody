## New

## Modules

- mod_account_activity
- mod_cloud_notify
- mod_flags
- mod_http_altconnect
- mod_s2s_auth_dane_in
- mod_server_info

### Administration

- Add 'watch log' command to follow live debug logs at runtime (even if disabled)
- mod_announce: Add shell commands to send messages to all users, online users, or limited by roles

### MUC

- Component admins are no longer room owners by default. This can be reverted
  to the old behaviour with `component_admins_as_room_owners = true`, but this
  has known incompatibilities with some clients. Instead, use the shell or
  ad-hoc commands to gain ownership of rooms when necessary.
- Permissions updates:
  - Room creation restricted to local users (of the parent host) by default
    - restrict_room_creation = true restricts to admins, false disables all restrictions
  - Persistent rooms can only be created by local users (parent host) by default
    - muc_room_allow_persistent = false restricts to admins
  - Public rooms can only be created by local users (parent host) by default
    - muc_room_allow_public = false restricts to admins
- Commands to show occupants and affiliations in the Shell
- Save 'reason' text supplied with affiliation change
- Owners can set MUC avatars (functionality previously in community module mod_vcard_muc)
