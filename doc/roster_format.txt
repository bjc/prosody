  [string bare_jid] = roster_item
}

table roster_item {
  string subscription = "none" | "to" | "from" | "both"
  string name = Opaque string set by client. (optional)
  set groups = a set of opaque strings set by the client
  boolean ask = nil | "subscribe" - a value of true indicates subscription is pending
