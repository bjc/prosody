These tests check that SSL/TLS configuration is working as expected.

Just run ./run.sh in this directory (or from the top level,
`make integration-test-tls`.

Known issues:
  - The tests do not thorougly clean up after themselves (certs, logs, etc.).
    This is partly intentional, so they can be inspected in case of failures.
  - Certs are regenerated every time. Could be smarter about this. But it also
    helps to guard against incorrect Prosody instances running and hogging the
    ports, etc.
